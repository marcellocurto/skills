# Explain Codebase

Build a working mental model of current behavior at the altitude the user needs. Trace what the system actually does; do not substitute annotated source code, architectural judgment, or an inferred history.

## Boundaries

- This skill is read-only. Do not edit code or documentation.
- Explain observed behavior before judging it. If the request also asks for problems or improvements, finish a self-contained explanation first, then use the relevant audit skill and keep its findings separate.
- Use `diagnosing-bugs` when the subject is broken, failing, incorrect, or slow. An explanation can orient diagnosis, but it does not establish a cause.
- State historical motivation only when an ADR, issue, commit, documentation, or another authoritative record supports it. Otherwise distinguish current purpose from inferred rationale.
- Resolve minor ambiguity by stating the working interpretation and proceeding. Ask only when different interpretations would produce materially different explanations.

## Trace the System

1. **Set the altitude.** Identify whether the user needs a narrow function walkthrough, a feature flow, or a subsystem map. Read `CONTEXT.md` and relevant ADRs when they exist, but verify their claims against current code.
2. **Find the real entry point.** Start from the trigger: a caller, route, event, job, command, user action, or public function. Use repository search and runtime wiring; do not infer the starting point from filenames.
3. **Follow trigger to effect.** Read each material handoff until the final output, state change, side effect, or external call. Track:
   - the module and function responsible for each step
   - the data entering, leaving, and changing at that step
   - important branches, validation, errors, retries, and asynchronous handoffs
   - state ownership, persistence, caches, queues, and external dependencies
   - seams where responsibility passes to another module or system
4. **Check runtime selection.** Confirm which adapter, implementation, configuration, flag, or registration the running path actually selects. Distinguish a possible path in source from the path used in the scenario being explained.
5. **Close evidence gaps.** Use callers, implementations, tests, configuration, and wiring to verify each material connection. If a handoff cannot be established, name the gap and what evidence is missing instead of guessing.

For a genuinely broad subsystem, divide exploration into independent slices such as entry and routing, data and state, and external effects. Explore those slices in parallel when delegation is available, then reconcile overlaps and contradictions against the code before writing the explanation. Keep narrow questions in one pass.

Stop exploring when the requested path can be explained from trigger to effect without hand-waving, the important data changes and seams are accounted for, and remaining uncertainty is explicit. Do not inventory the whole repository.

## Explain the Result

Lead with the answer at the user's requested altitude. Adapt the structure rather than filling a mandatory template; include only sections that improve the mental model:

- **Overview:** what the code path or subsystem does and where it begins and ends
- **Flow:** the ordered runtime path, including material data transformations and decisions
- **Key concepts:** only the types, modules, or domain terms needed to follow the flow
- **Where it lives:** the smallest useful map of entry points and implementation files
- **Gotchas and unknowns:** surprising behavior, runtime selection, sharp edges, and unresolved evidence gaps

Reference exact files and symbols so the reader can inspect the evidence. Prefer prose over code dumps. Use a small flow, sequence, or state diagram only when relationships across several modules are materially clearer visually.

Keep observed facts, supported rationale, and inference visibly distinct. The explanation should let an engineer predict what happens for a representative input and know where to begin changing or debugging it, without itself proposing the change or diagnosis.
